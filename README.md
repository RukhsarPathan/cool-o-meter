## 🔥 Cool-O-Meter – Vote the Coolest Subject on Campus!
Cool-O-Meter is a single-page, gamified web application built with HTML CSS AND VANILLE JAVASCRIPT that allows university students to anonymously vote for the academic subject they think is the “coolest.” 🎓✨
Votes are visually represented with dynamic progress bars and live percentage updates, making the experience fun, competitive, and interactive — like a mini leaderboard war between disciplines.

### 🎯 Key Features:
	• ✅ Anonymous Voting No login required. Users simply vote once for their favorite subject and can’t vote again.
	• 🎨 Stylish UI + Hover Effects Custom-designed subject cards with hover animations, cool buttons ("Vote"), and color-coded progress bars.
	• 📊 Live Coolness Meter Each subject displays a real-time percentage (0–100%) showing how cool it is based on total votes.
	• 🏆 Top 3 Leaderboard Highlight The top 3 most-voted subjects are visually highlighted with stylish gold, silver, and bronze badges.
	• 💻 Built With HTML, CSS, JavaScript — with reusable styling, Firebase Firestore to store votes and update percentages in real time.

### 👨‍💻 Ideal Use Case:
Originally built for the Meeedly Global Summer Challenge, Cool-O-Meter showcases frontend skills, leadership, and team collaboration in a real-world global tech challenge. The goal was to create a lighthearted app that promotes student engagement, creativity, and clean technical execution — all without storing personal data.

### 🚀 Future Enhancements:
	• UI Enhancement
